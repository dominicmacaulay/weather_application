# README
This is an ActiveRecord backed weather application. It requires a unique name for
your location and a valid and unique ip address to create a location object. The
location will then display the next seven days' worth of weather high's and low's.

To get started, click 'Add New Location' and fill in the required information.
Remember, the name and ip address have to be unique to this specific location and
the ip address needs to be valid, otherwise, the location will fail to be created.
After you have created your location, you can edit it, delete it, or go back and 
create more or view other locations.

You can view this application on Heroku [here.](https://shrouded-ocean-73166-bc3ba23d03ae.herokuapp.com/)

This application runs on Ruby 3.2.2 on Rails 7.1.3
